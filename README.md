# GraWIToN Statistics Lecture notes

This repository contains lecture notes (in Markdown, LaTeX and pdf format), figures and python scripts for figure
generation, for a set of statistics lectures giving at the
[1<sup>st</sup> GraWIToN School](https://events.ego-gw.it/indico/conferenceDisplay.py?ovw=True&confId=13).

The python scripts a licensed under the MIT Licence (see the LICENCE file),
whilst the lecture notes (Markdown, LaTeX and pdf files) are licenced under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, which can be viewed [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The lecture notes are written using the Markdown markup language and converted to beamer files
using the [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) tool. The
lecture notes use the beamer [m theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme). To
compile the notes a modified version of [peg-multimarkdown-latex-support](https://github.com/mattpitkin/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support) is required. You should also have the [Fira Sans](http://www.carrois.com/fira-4-1/) font installed.
